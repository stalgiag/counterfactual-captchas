    <p class='body-text'>What does it mean for machine learning to be reactionary?</p>
  </div>
  <div class='content-module inactive'>
    <p class='body-text'>We are training machines with data about our current world. The machines then accept that data as an inevitability. That set of conditions, that series of events, were always meant to be as they are. In this way we are building machines that are only capable of continuing the story as it is already understood.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='content-module inactive'>
    <p class='body-text'>The trick of deviation, the emergent, the generative, are really permutations of known truth as by those that design the boundaries of the training set.</p>

  <div class='content-module inactive'>
    <p class='body-text'>The truths told by the training data of our world also posits a worldview, typically one that reifies hegemony. We see this time and time again in AI that learn from supposedly objective databases but end up replicating the biases of incumbent power structures such as white supremacy. Truth is a tricky topic in this moment but the fact that our grasp on it is slipping can serve to help us realize that facts are always defined and constituted by the ruling class.</p>

    <!-- DATA SCIENCE MEME -->

  <div class='content-module inactive'>
    <p class='body-text'>If AI as a technology can be used as a weapon against the endless reproduction of the status quo, we need data that speaks of a world that isn’t true yet. We need data that speaks to the desires that aren’t reflected in hegemony. I believe that artists are uniquely positioned to collect the subsurface abolitionist dreams, the discrete insurrectionary rage, the reckless abandon of a new world that constitute a collective speculative truth.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='content-module inactive'>
    <p class='body-text'>How do we do this?</p>
    <p class='body-text'>We can turn to a strategy that platforms have used to gather data since the advent of machine learning: distributed labor.</p>

    <!-- CAPTCHA IMAGE -->

  <div class='content-module inactive'>
    <p class='body-text'>Big tech has long used CAPTCHAS to generate data for tasks like ...</p>
  </div>
  <div class='content-module inactive'>
    <!-- OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION -->
  </div>
  <div class='content-module inactive'>
    <!-- OR CV FOR SELF-DRIVING CARS -->
  </div>
  <div class='content-module inactive'>
    <p class='body-text'>The captcha is unique in that it elicits knowing and intentional participation. Many methods for data extraction rely on reading past records or secretly monitoring behavior.  These approaches to data harvesting are not suitable to a speculative.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='content-module inactive'>
    <p class='body-text'>My project, counterfactual, is a tool that helps artists create captchas. Any JS canvas can be used and the backend is able to detect most forms of automated attacks.</p>
    <p class='body-text'>It also gives artists full invitation to explore all of that lovely dithering distortion that the visual history of CAPTCHAS offers.</p>

    <!-- CAPTCHAS SUPERCUT -->

  <div class='content-module inactive'>
    <p class='body-text'>We can ask questions that lead us to reflect on the complexity of categories that are often taken as absolutes.</p>

    <p class='body-text'>Captchas can be to can build data sets that speak to redefined power relationships.</p>

    <div class='canvas-container' id='influence'></div>

  <div class='content-module inactive'>
    <p class='body-text'>Captchas can be used to build training sets that teach machines what could be instead of what is.</p>

  </div>
  <div class='content-module inactive'>
    <p class='body-text'>Of course, the utility of the data that comes from these experiments is limited but rhetorically it begins to peel away at base assumptions in data science that drive a pattern of technosocial reproduction. This is a vital step if we hope to make tools of liberation using Artificial Intelligence.</p>
